To install you need to download the ZIP unzip and go to chrome://extensions and makes sure on the top right corner that deveopler mode is enabled.
Next on a bar up the top is a button that says ¨load unpacked¨ then select the unzipped folder and press open then if you search Sith Lords or Sith Lord with a capital C it will come up with Sith Lords.
When you search up Jedi Knight/s with capital d it will come up with Jedi Knight/s.
